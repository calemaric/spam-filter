An iPhone is one cluttered and disorganised home screen then, as there is nowhere to put your apps except in a folder and this requires yet another action to open. These are the fastest ways i know of phoning a favourite on an iPhone. You raise your iPhone to wake up the screen, swipe right to see the Today view, swipe to Favorites widget and tap the person’s face to call or message the contact. That is 4 actions minimal and you may have to scroll down to find the contact and you cannot WhatsApp or use any other messaging app other than Apples. Slow and limiting.

With 3d touch you need to unlock your phone, find the phone app, use 3d touch then only if the contact is u require is visible can you call then. Messaging again is longer and less flexible.

For me one action only, it's so much easier to use and set up too especially for the widgit solution.

"First ... admit the real problem with Android Wear. I can get a Moto G Play, a phone that is good enough to meet the needs of 95% of the population - based on the fact that it is more powerful and capable than the iPhone and flagship Android phones like the Galaxy S3 (i.e. Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 and 1 GB of RAM versus 2 GB of RAM and Snapdragon 410) were in 2013 - for $99. Meanwhile the cheapest Android Wear option on this list costs nearly 3 times as much? 

Instead of creating Android Wear as a tablet bluetooth extension for your phone (seriously, that is how it was initially designed, and Google kept manufacturers from adding more code to it in order to make it better and useful ... the way Samsung did with TouchWiz, which is why it took Android Wear 2 years to catch up with Samsung Tizen devices that were released in 2015, which is when they first had 3G and mobile payments capability) Google should have made Android Wear a minimalist platform to compete with Fitbit, something like the Fitbit Charge 2 that could have been sold for $69 - $99. A couple of companies actually did try to make an Android Wear device for as little as $69 but gave up; the requirements for smartwatch SOC and display made it impossible. One of them eventually came out with a far more expensive smartwatch that did not sell, the other, Xiaomi, never came out with an Android Wear device at all, and instead went with their own wearable platform which is cheaper and far more successful. 

The amazing thing is that Google never did need to come out with a separate OS for Android Wear, since Android Wear has the same memory and CPU requirements as, say, Android Jellybean did. (Even now, the requirements for Android One is 512 MB of RAM and a Qualcomm 200 SOC; some of the watches above surpass that.) Sony and Samsung already had smartwatches running tablet Android. Google should have come out with a minimalist platform, like they did with Chrome OS for the Chromecast (successful precisely because it cost $35) like their IoT platform (first Brillo now Android Things). Because here is the deal: people will pay for a device that hangs off another device only if it is cheap. Chromecast? Without a phone or tablet or at least a PC with a Chrome browser it is a paperweight. Android Wear similarly is just another watch, no better than a $25 Casio, without a smartphone to pair with it, so charging more for it than a pretty good smartphone like the Asus Zenfone 3 makes no sense.

Everything that Google has done with Android Wear since it's launch has been to tack on new features to try to compete with the more successful Samsung Gear and Apple Watch devices by adding features like Wi-Fi, NFC and a better UI, but since the original design for Android Wear was to make the thing a voice controlled remote for your phone, it is putting lipstick on a pig. Google hasn't even made Wear-specific Hangouts, Voice, Messenger etc. apps for the platform or real support for tablets or PCs (i.e. using the Chrome browser) because again the original design was as a phone's voice remote. 

Google had an opportunity to relaunch Android Wear, at least for entry level devices, as a Fitbit/Garmin type competitor with Android Things as an OS when they could have bought Jawbone for two slices of bread and some butter. They could have pushed Android Things out to existing Jawbone devices (which includes speakers by the way) as an update and inherited their existing hardware designs. Instead, they decided to double down on a failed strategy by ""updating"" the platform to compete with Apple. Google's real problem: they are not a consumer products company whose main thing is designing products that actual people want to use and buy. They are an ad company, which is why they came up with an expensive product with no practical uses for the average person, one that they did not even really advertise. They are able to do this because it doesn't cost them anything. LG, Motorola, Asus and the rest are the ones who lose money by manufacturing and selling these product failures that no one buys. Now that Motorola is owned by Lenovo, who is actually trying to make money instead of having their losses subsidized by Google, they have made it clear that no more Android Wear devices are forthcoming.

Evidence that Google is serious about competing in the wearables space would be their buying Jawbone - still on their last legs, now they have totally given up on making and selling or even licensing hardware - and relaunching Android Wear as a cheap device that pairs with your phone over Bluetooth, NFC or WiFi, collects fitness and GPS data, etc. And not just watch type devices ... smart bluetooth headphones that can do everything that a Fitbit can do would be an even better idea. They can still have the ""tablet on a wrist"" devices for whoever wants them. But unless they do something in that area, it will show that Google is just willing to have other people lose money on their bad ideas rather than committing themselves to creating a successful product.",0,0,0,FALSE,disqus_OgNQ9QyA6R,Average,FALSE,0,TRUE

"I probably average around 3 hours or less SOT. I'm lucky to hit 4 or more.

Best part is actually extended batteries. I've been using the ZeroLemon for a few weeks. Never had to worry about battery life with that, but it made the phone so uncomfortable to use. Switched back to the stock battery yesterday and regretted it by lunch time. A spare battery is necessary, which I have, but I'm thinking about buying the 6400 mAh extended battery from Hyperion. Double the life of stock and a lot more comfortable to use than ZeroLemon.

Everyone's use is different. With mine, the V20 is barely manageable on a single battery on a single charge. I'm also kind of over the size. Coming from the G3 and G4, I was stoked for a bigger phone. After having the V20 since launch, I'm thinking I'd be happier back down at a 5.5"" screen.

"This past year i've owned the Nexus 6P, Note 5, Note 7, Galaxy S7, Moto Z Play, Sony Xperia X Compact, and now LG V20 (definitely think i'm forgetting 1). Anyways, imo the Galaxy phones and v20 have cameras that are a big step up from all the rest as it pertains to auto mode getting great shots the majority of the time. For me the Z Play was slow to focus. The X Compact takes an ETERNITY between most shots. Something happening between the capture and putting it in the gallery/photos. My most recent Samsung, the galaxy s7 (which my wife owns so i can use whenever) you can just SNAP, SNAP, SNAP and get great, in focus shots. Same thing with my current V20: SNAP, SNAP, SNAP. no delay just plenty of good shots. And LOVE the wide angle lens on the V20.

I don't know. I guess i just value camera above all else with 2 toddlers now and with the Moto and Sony i was getting plenty of blurry shots b/c of a slow picture take or inability to take another picture fast. Don't ever have that with the Samsung or V20. I'm tempted to try out one of the new Huawei's (mainly interested in the smoothness of the UI due to the Kirin proc) but out of the usual suspects i will be sticking to LG and Samusng and avoiding Moto's, Sony's, HTCs. Even though i agree with this article about missing the Moto mods, the battery life and the moto notifications. And of course once Samsung gets their ish together and releases the Note 8, i will be getting that and sticking with it until the next Note phone. All phones are basically the same now with small differentiators but no one has a stylus with the capability of the Note series. Can't wait :)",0,0,0,FALSE,disqus_UdO1x53Pqb,Average,TRUE,0,FALSE
"""I did AT&T full fat for a while and didnt find their LTE to be reliably faster than 8MB/s anyway""

Reliably.  I tried multiple carriers pre-paid.  Hell, in some spots at our super suburban offices I could get 58 down with Sprint but only an idiot would say ""You can reliably get 58 down with Sprint.""  Actually, in the Southeast T-Mobile's HSPA+ was often faster (18Mb/s) than AT&T in the dense areas, but again reliably.  The moment you left the city you might get zero.

Most of what I saw around Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, NYC and Kansas City on AT&T proper was about 8-10.  I occasionally saw faster but it wasnt always that fast.  And, to be honest, 8 is plenty to do what 99% of users need, most arent streaming 1080p.",0,0,0,FALSE,archercc,Average,TRUE,0,FALSE
