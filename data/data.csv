Fourth, did you read your comment before publishing?

"One of the most baffling product releases HTC has done in a while. Including a secondary display was a mistake because the function of a ticker just isn't as essential as the overall ergonomics of handling a phone. However, it's the release date that's even worse. If this would have been out around the time the V20 and Note 7 were on the market, different story, especially because its specs are actually pretty tight. But releasing it now, during this high-profile timeframe, without carrier support, at $750, and not including essential items like a 3.5 mm-to-USB-C adapter?

That is 4 actions minimal and you may have to scroll down to find the contact and you cannot WhatsApp or use any other messaging app other than Apples. Slow and limiting.

With 3d touch you need to unlock your phone, find the phone app, use 3d touch then only if the contact is u require is visible can you call then. Messaging again is longer and less flexible.

For me one action only, it's so much easier to use and set up too especially for the widgit solution.

"First ... admit the real problem with Android Wear. I can get a Moto G Play, a phone that is good enough to meet the needs of 95% of the population - based on the fact that it is more powerful and capable than the iPhone and flagship Android phones like the Galaxy S3 (i.e. Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 and 1 GB of RAM versus 2 GB of RAM and Snapdragon 410) were in 2013 - for $99. Meanwhile the cheapest Android Wear option on this list costs nearly 3 times as much? 

Instead of creating Android Wear as a tablet bluetooth extension for your phone (seriously, that is how it was initially designed, and Google kept manufacturers from adding more code to it in order to make it better and useful ... the way Samsung did with TouchWiz, which is why it took Android Wear 2 years to catch up with Samsung Tizen devices that were released in 2015, which is when they first had 3G and mobile payments capability) Google should have made Android Wear a minimalist platform to compete with Fitbit, something like the Fitbit Charge 2 that could have been sold for $69 - $99. A couple of companies actually did try to make an Android Wear device for as little as $69 but gave up; the requirements for smartwatch SOC and display made it impossible. One of them eventually came out with a far more expensive smartwatch that did not sell, the other, Xiaomi, never came out with an Android Wear device at all, and instead went with their own wearable platform which is cheaper and far more successful. 

The amazing thing is that Google never did need to come out with a separate OS for Android Wear, since Android Wear has the same memory and CPU requirements as, say, Android Jellybean did. (Even now, the requirements for Android One is 512 MB of RAM and a Qualcomm 200 SOC; some of the watches above surpass that.) Sony and Samsung already had smartwatches running tablet Android. Google should have come out with a minimalist platform, like they did with Chrome OS for the Chromecast (successful precisely because it cost $35) like their IoT platform (first Brillo now Android Things). Because here is the deal: people will pay for a device that hangs off another device only if it is cheap. Chromecast? Without a phone or tablet or at least a PC with a Chrome browser it is a paperweight. Android Wear similarly is just another watch, no better than a $25 Casio, without a smartphone to pair with it, so charging more for it than a pretty good smartphone like the Asus Zenfone 3 makes no sense.

Everything that Google has done with Android Wear since it's launch has been to tack on new features to try to compete with the more successful Samsung Gear and Apple Watch devices by adding features like Wi-Fi, NFC and a better UI, but since the original design for Android Wear was to make the thing a voice controlled remote for your phone, it is putting lipstick on a pig. Google hasn't even made Wear-specific Hangouts, Voice, Messenger etc. apps for the platform or real support for tablets or PCs (i.e. using the Chrome browser) because again the original design was as a phone's voice remote. 

Google had an opportunity to relaunch Android Wear, at least for entry level devices, as a Fitbit/Garmin type competitor with Android Things as an OS when they could have bought Jawbone for two slices of bread and some butter. They could have pushed Android Things out to existing Jawbone devices (which includes speakers by the way) as an update and inherited their existing hardware designs. Instead, they decided to double down on a failed strategy by ""updating"" the platform to compete with Apple. Google's real problem: they are not a consumer products company whose main thing is designing products that actual people want to use and buy. They are an ad company, which is why they came up with an expensive product with no practical uses for the average person, one that they did not even really advertise. They are able to do this because it doesn't cost them anything. LG, Motorola, Asus and the rest are the ones who lose money by manufacturing and selling these product failures that no one buys. Now that Motorola is owned by Lenovo, who is actually trying to make money instead of having their losses subsidized by Google, they have made it clear that no more Android Wear devices are forthcoming.

Evidence that Google is serious about competing in the wearables space would be their buying Jawbone - still on their last legs, now they have totally given up on making and selling or even licensing hardware - and relaunching Android Wear as a cheap device that pairs with your phone over Bluetooth, NFC or WiFi, collects fitness and GPS data, etc. And not just watch type devices ... smart bluetooth headphones that can do everything that a Fitbit can do would be an even better idea. They can still have the ""tablet on a wrist"" devices for whoever wants them. But unless they do something in that area, it will show that Google is just willing to have other people lose money on their bad ideas rather than committing themselves to creating a successful product.",0,0,0,FALSE,disqus_OgNQ9QyA6R,Average,0,TRUE

Therefore the fingerprint will work in most situations but when you are at your desk you can use a pin or pattern to quickly unlock without having to lift the phone?

In what way is it not convenient? When I grab my phone, my thumb is already on the home button, so it's unlocked by the time I see the screen. That's beside the point - when it's on a dock, or mounted in a car, it's not easy to get your finger on the the back of the phone. When I'm cooking and have it on the counter, it's really inconvenient to unlock by pin or pick it up and unlock it from behind.
